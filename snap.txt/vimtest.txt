The quick brown fox jump over the lazy dog.
A journey of a thousand miles  mouse begins with a single step.
To err is human, to forgive divine.
Better later then never,but never late is better.
Success usually comes to those who are too busy to be looking for it 
Replace early bird catches the worm,but the second gets the cheese
